# Bug Bee Gone

This is a application that will allow you to track bugs and issues.  
The is app is written with react for the frontend and DOTNET for the backend.

### My Approach

The approach I took was to create the tables first using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.  
Once the tables have been created, the endpoints and api was created. Postman was then used to test the endpoints and api.  
The frontend was then started, and the basic idea was to create basic pages to allow functionality to be implemented and tested.

###

The tracking for this app is be done by utilizing the [Task-Manager](https://github.com/j-bloom/Task-Manager) application I created.  
The task manager is be used to track tasks and TODOs that need to be completed, and ideas that I have for this Bug Tracker.
